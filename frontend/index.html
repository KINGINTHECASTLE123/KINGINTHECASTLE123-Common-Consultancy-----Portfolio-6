        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p id="p1">The Russo-Ukrainian war has seen a meaningful impact on lives, economies and geopolitics, causing a ripple effect throughout the entire world. In retrospect, present and foreseeable future, discussions about this war will remain a central part of daily life. In relation to this topic, we have attempted to design a webpage that analyzes public opinion of the ongoing war in Ukraine through visualisations.</p>

        <p id="p2">The Data stems from Facebook posts presented by Common Consultancy, who have analyzed hundreds of thousands of records and labeled the sentiment accordingly. We have chosen not to include data that contains posts which are classified as neutral, as finding sentiment through a neutral standpoint is not viable in this context.</p>
